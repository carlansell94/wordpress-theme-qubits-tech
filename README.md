A classic Wordpress theme, with a modern responsive design. Can be seen in action at https://qubitsandbytes.co.uk.

Currently at an early stage of development, but is in a usable state should you wish to try it out.

Features:
* Support for a logo and banner image
* Custom functions to return related posts/pages
* Custom archive block
* Fully responsive design
* Fallback default post/page thumbnail image
* Support for a page hierarchy of up to 3 levels
* Bespoke SVG icons

The custom archive blog can be accessed using the shortcode [qb_archive]. It lists posts by year, with months and individual posts accessible through a slide-down menu.


## Future Plans
* Add animations to navigation menu
* Improvements to image srcset handling
* Post grid layout
* Dark theme
* Theme customisation using 'WP Customizer'


## Theme Tweaks
The theme makes use of CSS variables, which are defined at the start of style.css. To tweak the side-wide colour scheme, tweak these values to suit.


## How To Use
Download the .zip file, and install it through the Wordpress 'Upload Theme' feature.
