A classic Wordpress theme, with a modern responsive design. This theme is designed with speed, customisation and SEO in mind.

Can be seen in action at https://qubitsandbytes.co.uk.

Currently at an early stage of development, but is in a usable state should you wish to try it out.

Features:
* Support for a logo and banner image
* Custom functions to return related posts/pages
* Fully responsive design
* Fallback default post/page thumbnail image
* Support for a page hierarchy of up to 3 levels
* Bespoke SVG icons
* Responsive images
* Dark theme, triggered by browser settings
* Customiser support
* Open Tag support
* Structured Data support

A custom archive block, with styling to match this theme, is available [here](https://github.com/carlansell94/qubits-tech-archive). It lists posts by year, with months and individual posts accessible through a slide-down menu.


## Images
The image sizes used by the theme are as follows:

* 2048x2048
* large: 1000x1000
* medium_large: 750x750
* medium: 375x375
* thumbnail: 75x75 (cropped)

The default 1536x1536 size has been removed.

It's recommended, but not required, to use images with a 2:1 width:height ratio for post thumbnails. Thumbnails of other sizes are cropped to a 2:1 ratio on the front end.

Utilises the srcset attribute to serve appropriately sized images. If desired, a setting is available to control the device pixel density used by srcset. This can reduce the resolution of the images sent to small-screen (but high-res) devices, lowering data usage.


## Future Plans
* Add animations to navigation menu
* Post grid layout


## Theme Tweaks
This theme supports customisation using the Wordpress customiser.


## How To Use
Download the .zip file, and install it through the Wordpress 'Upload Theme' feature.
